#' @title Coin Flip versus Die Roll Game
#'
#' @description This function simulates a game involving two players. Person A
#' flips a fair coin initially, with the objective of getting a head. Person B
#' rolls a fair six-sided die after Person Aâ€™s move with the obejective of getting
#' a 1, 2, 3, or 4. The game is repeated until one person is able to complete his
#' or her objective first thereby winning the game. The winner of the game
#' receives a 1 while the loser receives a 0.
#'
#' @details The function plays one round of the game referenced in
#' Example 1.4.8 (8th Edition). There is no input required to run this simulation.
#' The function defines all possible outcomes of a coin toss or the rolling of a
#' die, as well as calculates the probability of both the coin landing on heads,
#' and the die landing on one through four.
#'
#' @return \code{results} contains the resulting score of one round of the game.
